title: Consensus Overview
description: Prepare for reviewing consensus layer Internet Computer Protocol replica upgrades
---

## Scope

- Consensus crate
- Artifact pool
- Chain key technology
- Ingress manager
- Orchestrator
- Ic-replay
- Upgrades
- Subnet recovery
- Subnet backup
- Subnet splitting

## Summary

- The consensus layer receives unordered messages from the P2P layer.
- Consensus achieves agreement as to which messages and in which order the IC should execute.
- It can do this as long as more than â…” of the nodes are honest and functioning well.
