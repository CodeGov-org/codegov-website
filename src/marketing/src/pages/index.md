Welcome to the CodeGov website. If you are interested in participating in reviews for ICP NNS Replica Version Management proposals, then you have come to the right place. We are looking for help. This website describes how the CodeGov project works. We use a [portal on DSCVR](https://dscvr.one/p/codegov) to review and discuss these proposals. Everyone is welcome to join the portal to view the content, but only reviewers and advisors are allowed to vote and comment. If you want to be a reviewer, then please feel free to [apply here](/apply). There are two main objectives for this project regarding proposal reviews...one is IC-OS Verification and the other is to perform a sanity check on the Release Notes. We want to encourage developers to spend just a couple of hours each week performing these important high-level reviews and vote on them independently.

> "...the vast majority of neuron holders (99+%) choose to follow the DFINITY foundation on the "Subnet Management" topic. This is not desirable, because voting should be as decentralized as possible."

> "To make it simpler for neurons to vote manually on certain topics, we propose to split the "Subnet management" topic into multiple topics. More precisely, we propose to add two new topics: Replica Version Management... (and) Subnet Replica Version Management..."

> "...with these changes we could imagine that some neurons will decide to manually vote on "Replica Version Management". Other neurons can now follow different experts on different topics, further decentralizing the vote."
